This project is no longer being maintained.  We've started a new project 
called "Meer" that reads Sagan and Suricata "EVE" log formats and "spools"
the to a traditional Snort/Barnyard2 style database.  That project can

-1. PRE-SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Barnyard2-extra - version 2-1.14 (Build 336-Quadrant-6)

This is a "fork" of https://github.com/firnsy/barnyard2.  This version 
contains functionality and features not found (yet) in the original 
Barnyard2.  The differences are:

1. Support of database storage of "ExtraData".  This includes: 
	
    EVENT_INFO_XFF_IPV4
    EVENT_INFO_XFF_IPV6
    EVENT_INFO_REVIEWED_BY
    EVENT_INFO_GZIP_DATA
    EVENT_INFO_SMTP_FILENAME
    EVENT_INFO_SMTP_MAILFROM
    EVENT_INFO_SMTP_RCPTTO
    EVENT_INFO_SMTP_EMAIL_HDRS
    EVENT_INFO_HTTP_URI
    EVENT_INFO_HTTP_HOSTNAME
    EVENT_INFO_IPV6_SRC
    EVENT_INFO_IPV6_DST
    EVENT_INFO_JSNORM_DATA

2. New database schema to store Unified2 "ExtraData".  Database differences
can be found at:

https://github.com/beave/barnyard2-extra/wiki/Barnyard2-Database-differences.

3. The ability to storge DNS data related to an event.  Why is this important?
   Shouldn't your favorite console do the lookup when it needs to?  No, because
   DNS can be dynamic.  Suppose Mary connects her laptop to your network. 
   She receives a DHCP lease and dynamic DNS of "mary.example.com".  Her
   machine is infected which causes Sagan/Snort/Suricata/etc to trigger
   an alert.  She then packs up her laptop and leaves.  Joe now connects his
   laptop to the network gets the previous lease (IP) Mary had.  Looking up 
   the IP address would associate "Joe's" PC with "Mary's" infection.  In 
   some cases,  recording the DNS of when the alert happened is important! 
   Using the --enable-dns allows Barnyard2 to store DNS in the "dns" table
   associated with the sid/cid.

   ./configure --enable-dns

   DNS lookups do add overhead to the logging process.  If you find DNS is 
   slowing your sensor down,   consider tuning and the following options 
   in your /etc/resolv.conf

   options timeout:1
   options attempts:1

4. It's important to know the health of a sensor.  In the past, I would
   create a rule that would trigger when a specially crafted packet or
   log message was received.  We could then check the "event" table to validate
   if the sensor is "up" and working properly.  The problem with this is that
   you quickly fill your event tables will "ping" or "health checks" data.  To 
   avoid this,  we can enable the --enable-healthcheck option.  The allows you
   to create a "health check" rule that will simply update the "health" 
   column in the "sensor" table with the current utime.  This works by the
   signature number.  By default,  if the signature ID is less than 
   20,000,000,  it is considered a normal signature.  If it is equal to or 
   greater than 20,000,000,  it is considered a "health" event which means
   only the "sensor" "health" column will be updated with the utime of 
   the event. 

   ./configure --enable-healthcheck

5. While barnyard2 has a flag to disable sig_reference table
   (disable_signature_reference_table=1), we've added a option to disable
   use of the reference table (disable_reference_table=1).  If you are
   not using the Snort "reference" table,  this option allows barnyard2
   to start much quicker.  For example:

   output database: log, mysql, user=user dbname=snortdb host=localhost \
   disable_signature_reference_table=1 disable_reference_table=1

   This patch is based off Jim Hranicky's work.  His patch can be found at
   (http://marc.info/?l=snort-users&m=143869778628989&w=2).  I've modified
   it a bit more to skip more "reference" checks. 

6. By default,  Barnyard2 doesn't log "fragmented" packets.  On properly 
   configured networks this is the correct thing to do.  The idea is 
   Barnyard2 lets Snort/Suricata reassumble the packet. However, we've 
   seen "screwy" network configurations where fragmented packets trigger
   a signature but are not recorded in the database.  Rather than silently
   "dropping" this data, the "log_frag" option allows Barnyard2 to record 
   the data regardless of fragmentation.  Add the following to the 
   "output database" line: 

   log_frag=1 

   To the barnyard2.conf line.

2. DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Barnyard2 is an open source interpreter for Snort unified2 binary output files.
Its primary use is allowing Snort to write to disk in an efficient manner and
leaving the task of parsing binary data into various formats to a separate
process that will not cause Snort to miss network traffic.

Barnyard2 has 3 modes of operation:
  1. batch (or one-shot),
  2. continual, and
  3. continual w/ bookmark.

In batch (or one-shot) mode, barnyard2 will process the explicitly specified
file(s) and exit.

In continual mode, barnyard2 will start with a location to look and a specified
file pattern and continue to process new data (and new spool files) as they
appear.

Continual mode w/ bookmarking will also use a checkpoint file (or waldo file in
the snort world) to track where it is. In the event the barnyard2 process ends
while a waldo file is in use, barnyard2 will resume processing at the last
entry as listed in the waldo file.

The "-f", "-w", and "-o" options are used to determine which mode barnyard2
will run in.  It is legal for both the "-f" and "-w" options to be used on the
command line at the same time, however any data that exists in the waldo file
will override the command line data from the "-f" and "-d" options. See the
command directives section below for more detail.

Barnyard2 processing is controlled by two main types of directives: input
processors and output plugins. The input processors read information in from a
specific format ( currently the spo_unified2 output module of Snort ) and
output them in one of several ways.
